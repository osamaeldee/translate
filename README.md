## Description

Our Translation App is a user-friendly and efficient tool designed to meet the needs of a diverse and global audience. It supports over 15 languages, including widely spoken languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and several African languages. This broad language support ensures that users from different linguistic backgrounds can easily communicate and understand each other.

The app is designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for users of all ages and technical abilities. The intuitive interface allows users to effortlessly select the input and output languages from a comprehensive list.
